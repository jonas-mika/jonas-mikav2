**Repommend** is a network-based recommendation system for GitHub repositories. Using the 2009 GitHub bipartite network, representing users watching repositories (unweighted graph),
the project builds a recommendation graph using the heuristic of common neighbors. The final product is a simple web-app, allowing users to search for repositories they like and get recommendations
for repositories that are similar to the ones they like.

The project was developed as part of the course "Network Analysis" at the IT University of Copenhagen together with [Ludek Cizinksy](https://cizinsky.cc) and [Lukas Rasocha](https://lukasrasocha.com). You can check out the code, report and final presentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/ludekcizinsky/project-repommend).
