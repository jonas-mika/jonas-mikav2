**MegaBites - Measuring, Modelling, and Improving the Sustainability of EPFL's food system** is part of EPFL's S4S (Solutions for Sustainability) inititatives to reduce the EPFL's campus-wide carbon footprint. The project aims to reduce the carbon footprint of EPFL's food system by at least 25% within two years using data-driven approaches to understand the food consumption patterns and the environmental impact of the food supply chain. The project will be structured in three main stages:

1. **Measuring**: Collecting data on the food consumption patterns and the environmental impact of the food supply chain.
2. **Modelling**: Causal Analysis and simulation of the food system to understand the impact of different interventions.
3. **Improving**: Interventions to reduce the carbon footprint of the food system.

The project is led by [Prof. Robert West](https://people.epfl.ch/robert.west) inside the Data Science Lab ([DLAB](https://dlab.epfl.ch)) at EPFL. I will be working as a research assistant on the project starting in spring 2024.
