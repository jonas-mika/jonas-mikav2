**AITU** is a student organisation at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk) that connects the brightest minds in machine learning and artificial intelligence from Copenhagen. The group meets weekly to discuss a selected research paper in an unpretentious setting that invites students of all levels to participate actively, ask question and share their insights. Beyond the weekly meetings, the group also hosts talks from AI researchers and practitioners from industry and organises and participates in hackathons and other events.

<br />

I have co-founded AITU in late 2022 together with [Ludek Cizinsky](https://cizinsky.cc) and [Lukas Rasocha](https://lukasrasocha.com) in an attempt to create a community around our shared interest and desire to understand cutting-edge artificial intelligence research. Since then, the group has grown to over 50 members, collaborates with other student organisations like [Bliss](https://bliss.berlin) in Berlin and has a partnership with [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/) that kindly provides us with a venue for our meetings.
