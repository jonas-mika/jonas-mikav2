My bachelor thesis - titled **Navigating Indoors with Computer Vision: Deep Learning Approaches for Room-Level Indoor Localisation** - investigates the performance of various state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for image and video classification (including _convolutional neural networks_, _convolutional recurrent neural networks_ and _Transformer-based models_) in the setting of room-level indoor localisation.
Simply put, the thesis answers the questions whether a purely visual model can learn to accurately predict, _where_ an agent is based on the continuous camera feed of a mobile device.

<br />

The project entailed the collection and annotation of a novel video dataset for indoor localisation, the implementation and training of the models, and a rigorous evaluation of the results. To test the findings in a real-world scenario, I developed a proof-of-concept mobile application using that uses the best performing model to localise a user in a building. The thesis was written in the context of the Bachelor of Science in Data Science at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk) and supervised by [Stella Grasshof](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/stella-grasshof) from the ML research group.
