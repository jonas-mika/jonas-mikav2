[AddisCoder](https://addiscoder.com) is a free intensive 4-week summer program
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia introducing high schoolers to programming and
algorithms.  The program was founded by [Prof. Jelani
Nelson](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~minilek/) in 2011 and has been run
ever since.  Alumni of the program have gone on to study at top universities
around the world and start companies.  I was lucky to be part of the staff that
helped run the program in 2024. My main responsibilities were to prepare the
curriculum and teach the students during lab sessions.

<br />

I want to thank all professors, teaching assistants and especially the students for making this an incredible experience.
