**ITU Coffee Talks** brings ITU staff and students together for engaging, research-focused discussions within the realm of computer science. Designed to foster a closer connection between faculty and students, the talks offer a unique opportunity for students to delve into academic topics with their professor in an informal environment beyond the regular classroom setting.

I started co-organising the event 2023. In this role, I was responsible for finding speakers, organising and marketing the event and moderating the talks.
