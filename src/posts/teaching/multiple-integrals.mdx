In this last week, we are talking about **multiple integrals**. Understanding integration in $n$ dimensions seems like a natural path to take after we
have already successfully extended differentation into $n$ dimension. As this is an introductory course, we will not cover general multiple integrals,
but will constrain ourselves to functions modelling surface in three-dimensional spcae $f:\R^2\rightarrow\R$. Integrals to such functions can be
visualised as volumnes under surfaces. Further, we will only evaluated these double integrals for bounds in the $xy$-plane described through
rectangles and general level curves.

One of the most common applications of multiple integrals is to evaluate probabilities of functions that describe the joint probability distribution
of two continuous random variables, which is an application that you will learn in more detail in the course _Applied Statistics_.

## Univariate Integration

---

Before we jump into integration in two dimensions, let's recall what it means to _integrate_ a function given as $f:\R\rightarrow\R$. The general
intuition of integration is that we want to be able to describe the area under the graph of a function in some interval $[a, b]$. Under the assumption
that $f$ is defined on this interval, we can divide the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals, each of equal width. Let's denote any subinterval as
$[x_{i-1}, x_{i}]$ with a width of $\Delta x=(b-a)/n$. Now, if we define sample points $x_i^*$ in each of these subintervals (a reasonable choice
would be the middle), then we get an approximation for the area under the graph as the sum over the area of all rectangles defined by the
subintervals.

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)\Delta x
$$

It becomes clear, that this approximation gets increasingly better, the more subintervals $n$ we create. In fact, if we take the limit of this sum for
$n\rightarrow\infty$, then we obtain the integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$

$$
lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)\Delta x
$$

Because of its importance in many applications, we give this expression a special notation, called an **integral**

$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx
$$

Luckily, we don't have to evaluate a limit expression anytime we want to obtain a definite integral. The **fundamental theorem of calculus** describes
that the integral of a function $f$ over a fixed interval is equal to the change of its antiderivative $F$ between the interval boundaries.

$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx = [F(x)]_b^a = F(b)-F(a)
$$

## Double Integration over Rectangles

---

Now we will extend the above concept, that you should all be familiar with to functions living in 3d instead of 2d. To have a well-defined problem,
let's consider that we wish to find the volume of the solid that lies above a rectangle $R$ and under the graph of $f$. Here, $f$ is a function from
$\R^2\rightarrow\R$ and we can define any rectangle as

$$
R=[a,b]\times[c,d]=\{(x,y)\in\R^2\ | a \le x \le b, c \le y \le d\}
$$

_Read: $R$ contains all pairs of points $(x,y)$ that lie within the rectangle bounded by $[a,b]$ and $[c,d]$._

Similarly to the univariate case, we start with dividing the rectangle into subrectangles. This is done by first dividing the $x$ dimension into $m$
subintervals $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ of width $\Delta x=(b-a)/m$ and equivalently, the $y$ dimension into $n$ subinterval $[y_{i-1}, y_i]$ of width
$\Delta y=(d-c)/n$. Again, we can use each subinterval to get an approximation of a "column" by choosing a sample point $(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)$ for
each subrectangle. In this way, we approximate the volume of the solid as the sum over the volumes of the columns of all subrectangles bounded by the
$f$ as

$$
\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)\cdot \Delta x \cdot \Delta y
$$

Since, $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ are constant, we can define the constant area of each subrectangle as $\Delta A=\Delta x \Delta y$ and rewrite

$$
\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)\cdot \Delta A
$$

Again, taking the approximation the smaller the subrectangles get. This is achieved by letting $m$ and $n$ go to infinity, so the double integral over
the rectangle $R$ is defined as

$$
\int\int_R f(x,y) dA = lim_{m,n\rightarrow\infty} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n f(x_{ij}^*, y_{ij}^*)\cdot \Delta A
$$

Similarly as in the univariate case, we don't have to evaluate a limit expression to find a definite double integral. **Fubini's Theorem** tells us
that we can divide the double integral into two univariate integrals, an _outer integral_ and an _inner integral_.

$$
\int\int_R f(x,y) dA = \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y)\ dy\ dx = \int_c^d \int_a^b f(x,y)\ dx\ dy
$$

_Pay attention to the bounds of the double integrals. In the first example the inner integral denotes the bounds along the $y$-dimension, and we
therefore also integrate w.r.t $y$ to evaluate the inner integral. The outer integral denotes the bounds along the $x$-dimension, so we integrate the
result of the inner integral w.r.t $x$. The order, whether to first integrate w.r.t $x$ or $y$ does not matter, but the bounds have to match the
integration variable._
