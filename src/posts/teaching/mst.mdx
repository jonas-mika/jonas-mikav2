A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum-weight spanning tree is a subset of the
edges of a connected, edge-weighted, undirected graph that connects all the
vertices together (=connected), without any cycles (=acyclic) and with the
minimum possible total edge weight (=minimising). That is, it is a spanning tree
whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

Let's have a closer look at why these three properties a graph needs to fulfil
in order to have a MST associated to it:

1. **Connectivity**

   There does not exist a single MST for unconnected graphs. We would rather
   compute the minimum spanning forest (which is a forest of MSTs for each
   connected component)

2. **Edge-Weighted**

   For a MST to be meaningful, it needs to have weights associated to each edge.
   Otherwise there is nothing to minimise. Note that in order for a unique MST
   to exist all weights of edges must be unique. Non-distinct edge weights may
   lead to multiple MSTs

   _Remember: An edge-weighted graph is a graph model where we associate weights
   (this could represent anything from distances to costs in real life
   applications) with each edge. Such type of graphs are natural models for many
   applications, such as ie. a graph representing a road network with
   intersections as vertices and roads with lengths as weighted edges._

3. **Undirected**

   For simplicity we choose to only observe MSTs in undirected graphs.

   _Note, that we can smartly compute the maximum spanning tree by either
   tweaking our algorithms (to ie. not select the minimum edge on each
   iteration, but the maximum) or recomputing the edge weights by multiplying
   with $-1$. This will make the maximum-weight edges minimal, and vice versa._

## Application

---

MSTs have plenty of real-life applications and have been studied for a long time
in graph theory. Therefore, the two algorithms that we will analyse to compute
MSTs belong to the oldest and most well-known algorithms in this course. They
have been studied at least since the 1920s; at first in the context of power
distribution networks, later in the context of telephone networks. MSTs are now
ie. important in the design of many networks and also in the study of
biological, checmical and physical networks that are found in nature:

- Communication Networks
- Electrical Networks
- Hydraulic Networks
- Computer Networks
- Infrastructure Networks (Road, Rail, Air, ...)

## MST API

---

As usual, we define an API where the constructor. For computing MST - as we have
seen - we need to provide an edge-weighted graph as argument. The API should
then support client query methods that return the MST and its weight. There are
many ways for us to return the MST, such as a list of edges (which is done in
this API), an edge-weighted graph or a vertex-indexed array with parent links.

## Basic Idea: Cut Property

---

All algorithms aiming to compute the MST of a graph are based on the same basic
two properties of any tree:

1. Adding an edge that connects two vertices that are in the MST creates a
   unique cycle
2. Removing an edge from a tree breaks it into two separate subtrees

This knowledge leads to what is called the cut property - a procedure to
identify edges that must be in the MST of a given edge-weighted graph, by
dividing its vertices into two sets and examining all possible connecting edges.

For finding MST, we can make the following proposition:

Given any cut (=partition of a graph's vertices into two nonempty disjoint sets)
in an edge-weighted graph, the crossing edge (=the edge that connects the two
connected components) of minimum weight is in the MST of the graph.

## Prim's Algorithm

---

Prim's Algorithm was invented by Jarnik in 1930 and rediscovered by Prim
in 1957. It is a greedy algorithm (=any algorithm that follows the
problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage) to
compute the minimum spanning tree of a given undirected, edge-weighed graph by
growing the MST one edge at a time from an arbitrarily chosen starting node, at
each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another
vertex.

1. Initialise the MST by arbitrarily choosing a vertex from the graph
2. Grow the tree by one edge by finding the minimum-weight edge in the frontier.
   The frontier is the set of all edges that connect the tree to vertices that
   are not yet in the graph.
3. Repeat the second step until all nodes are in the MST (`V-1` edges will be
   added)

While the general idea of Prim's algorithm is easy to grasp, it is yet unclear
how to efficiently keep track of the vertices and edges that already part of the
MST, the frontier and how to iterate over the vertices to find the minimum
weight edge.

To implement Prim's algorithm we therefore define three simple and familiar data
structures.

- **Vertices on the Tree**: Vertex-Indexed Boolean Array `marked[]`, where
  `marked[v]` is true if `v` is on the tree

- **Edges on the Tree:** We use either a queue `mst` to collect the MST edges or
  a vertex indexed array `edgeTo[]` of Edge objects, where `edgeTo[v]` is the
  edge that connects v to the tree.

- **Crossing Edges:** `Min-PQ<Edge>` priority queue that compared edges by their
  weight (defined in `Edge` data type)

The combination of these three data types allow us to answer the question:
"Which is the minimal-weight crossing edge?" or "Which is the next vertex I need
to connect from the frontier such that the edge weight is minimal, and
therefore - by proposition of the cut property part of the MST.

Note that we can differentiate between _lazy_ and _eager_ version of Prim's
algorithm. Every time we add a minimum edge to our MST, we also add a vertex
(the _other_ incident vertex of the minimum edge) which expands the frontier
(since we now also consider all edges valid edges from this vertex). This
results in some edges that were on the frontier to become ineligible, since they
are incident to this specific edge (this however is prohibited in MST each
vertex must have degree one = acyclic).

In the lazy implementation, we just keep those ineligible edges in our `MinPQ`
and check at every pop of a minimum edge, whether it is ineligible.

In the eager implementation, we delete ineligible edges dynamically every time
we add an edge to our MST.

## Kruskal's Algorithm

---

Kruskal's algorithm is another example of finding the MST of an undirected,
edge-weighted graph. In contrast to Prim's algorithm Kruskal's algorithm is able
to find MSTs for unconnected graphs (without any modification to the initial
algorithm), ie. it finds the minimum spanning forest. Kruskal's algorithm
therefore computes the MST of any edge-weighted connected graph.

1. Sort all edges by increasing weight (lowest to highest)
2. Add the lowest weight edge to the MST that does not create a cycle with edges
   previously edges
3. Repeat the second step until all vertices are in the MST (ie. $V-1$ edges
   were added)

_Note that Kruskal's algorithm, just like Prim's algorithm, builds the MST one
edge at a time; but, by contrast, it finds the edge that connects two trees in a
forest of growing trees._

To implement Kruskal's algorithm efficiently, we will use a lot of the
previously acquired tools:

- **Edges in the Tree**: `MinPQ<Edge>` that stores all edges in order of their
  weight
- **Checking for Cycles**: `UnionFind` to identify edges that cause cycles (if
  incident vertices of current edge are already in MST (connected component),
  the edge is ineligble)
- **Edges in MST:** `Queue` (as in _Prim's_)

## Exercise Solutions

### Trace of Prim's, Kruskal's and Dijkstra's Algorithm

---

```text
Prims: [(A-B), (B-C), (C-D), (D-E)]
Kruskals: [(E-D), (B-C), (C-D), (A-B)]
Dijkstra's: [(A-B), (A-D), (B-C), (E-D)]
```

### 4.3.1 Rescaling Weights of MST

---

If all weights are equally scaled in a graph, the MST topology stays unchanged
and the total MST weight scales proportionally. That is, because whether or not
an edge is part of the MST does not depend on its absolute value, but whether it
is smaller or greater than the other edges. If all edge weights are scaled
proportionally, the relationship between all edges remains unchanged.
Mathematically, we can show for two edges with weight $x$ and $y$

$$
x < y  \Leftrightarrow c \cdot x < c \cdot y, \quad \forall c > 0
$$

$$
x < y  \Leftrightarrow c + x < c + y, \quad \forall c \in \mathbb{R}
$$

### 4.3.7 Maximum-Spanning-Tree

---

We can easily find the maximum spanning tree of a graph using unchanged
implementations of Prim's or Kruskal's if we reverse all weights by multiplying
the entire edge weights in the graph with a negative scalar (i.e. $-1$).

Another option is to change the Min-PQ in both Prim's or Kruskal's to a Max-PQ,
such that at each iteration the edge is added that maximises the total edge
weight of the MST.

### 4.3.12 MSTs with Unique Edge Weights

---

_Does the shortest edge have to be on the MST?_ Yes. Consider Kruskal's
algorithm, which will always add the shortest edge first.

_Can the longest edge belong to the MST?_ Yes, if the original graph already is
a tree or the longest edge is the only edge connecting a node to the rest of the
nodes, so it has to be part of the MST for connectivity.

_Does a min-weight edge on every cycle have to belong to the MST?_ No, because
the edge can create a cycle, i.e. tries to connect to nodes that have already
been connected through another path, which makes the edge illegible.

### 4.3.3 Uniqueness of MST

---

If all edge weights are unique, the MST is also unique. Consider the cut
property, which for a partition of the graph nodes into two non-empty sets,
defines that the edge with minimum weight has to be on the MST. If all edge
weights are distinct, then for every partition, there exists exactly one edge
that is minimal. Following this procedure, the MST has to be unique. This can
also be easily seen from Kruskal's algorithm, which iterates over all edges from
smallest to largest edge. If edge weights are unique, there exists only a single
ordering of the edges.

### 4.3.4 Uniqueness of MST

---

If edge weights are non-unique, then the MST is non-unique. Consider the
complete graph of 3 nodes, with equal edge weights (i.e. 1). There are three
possible MSTs.

```text
  2
 / \
1 - 3
```

### 4.3.14 Replacing MST edges

---

Finding a replacement for an edge between two nodes u-v that is part of the MST
of some graph G, requires to iterate over all edges and choosing the edge that
also connects u-v with the next smallest edge weight to be the replacement of
the original edge. This follows from the cut property and is an algorithm that
runs in linear time in the number of edges.

### 4.3.32 Specified Set

---

Prim's: Add all edges in the set $S$ into the queue of MST nodes. Update the
Min-PQ with the frontier and mark all nodes that are part of the MST through the
edges in S as True. Then continue regularly with Prim until the MST consists of
V-1 edges.

Kruskal's: Run the UF data structure on the edges in S. Then continue with
regular Kruskal's until the MST consists of V-1 edges.

### Exam 190820 4 A/B

Slow using Repeated Graph Traversal:

The pseudo-approach to this algorithm goes as follows:

View the input as a graph (linear linked-list in the one-dimensional case and
complex graph in two dimensional world). Initialise the number of days to `0`,
then begin iteratively:

1. Check the connectivity of the graph. Count the total number of grass fields.
   Randomly choose one grass field and start a graph traversal algorithm (DFS/
   BFS) from that node and keep track of the number of grass fields that have
   been visited. The traversal visits all neighboring grass fields at each
   iteration. This requires a slight modification of the standard algorithm.

2. If the number of visited fields is equal to the number of grass fields, the
   algorithm ends and we can return the number of days `d`. Otherwise, we lower
   all water tiles by 1, transforming tiles of depth 1 into grass fields and
   increase the number of days `d`.

3. The algorithm either ends with connectivity being reached after some number
   of days or if there are no more water tiles to lower. In the latter case we
   return `Impossible`.

Fast, using MST:

We can efficiently solve the problem with an MST algorithm like Prim's or
Kruskal's. Build a graph of $RC$ vertices, each vertex having 6 edges, each
having the weight of the highest water level of its connecting vertices. Lava
tiles have no edges.

Allow the constructor to take a given vertex as a starting point. Change the
while loop to run until the priority queue is empty or remaining ground tiles
are zero. Then change the visit method so that when it visits an unvisited
ground tile, it decrements the count of the remaining ground tiles. Also,
compare the edge weight to the previous max weight traversed, and store the
largest of the two. Call the algorithm with any ground tile as it's starting
vertex. When it finishes, check if remaining ground tiles is zero. If it is,
return the max edge weight traversed. If not, return impossible.

The running time to create the graph with at most 6RC edges is O(RC). The
modified Prim's algorithm then solves the problem in O(RC log RC) as the number
of edges is at most 6 per vertex.
