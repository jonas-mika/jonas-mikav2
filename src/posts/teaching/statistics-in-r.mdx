`R` is a generic programming language and software environment, that was
specifically designed to be used for statistical analysis. It Because it was
first-hand designed to for statistical analysis, it provides powerful
out-of-the-box tools that we use on a day to day basis when doing statistical
analysis and modelling in our programming environments as data scientists.

R was designed for people to be used without prior programming experience, and
therefore abstracts away a lot software and hardware details. Instead, it comes
bundled with a lot pre-built function with intuitive, english-like syntax.

This post assumes that you are all set with your environment and are ready tor
write R code. If you are note, or are looking for some tips for installation or
an optimal workflow in R, check out the post about
[R Development Environment](https://mikasenghaas.de/teaching/stats/r-environment)
for a detailled description about how to install and setup your R environment
properly.

## Basics

---

### Variable Assignment

---

We assign variables with the `<-` (left assignment) operator (_or rarely, right
assignment operator `->`_). In the global syntax `=` also works, but has
limitations for the places it can be used. `<-` is therefore the universally
accepted standard and recommended to use. We use `=` to ie. provide function
arguments.

```r
todo.today <- "Learn R"
```

_Note: Since we don't use dots to refer to subpackages and packages, we can use
them in variable names_

### Comments and Printing

---

You can write inline lines with `#`. `R` doesn't support multi-line comments by
default, so you will have to add `#` in front of every commenting line. You can
add them conviently using short cuts in your editor of choice.

```r
# this is a comment
```

You can "print" to standard output for displaying computation results or
debugging reasons either using the `print` or `cat` function. Using `cat` you
can combine multiple

We can printout all variable currently saved in the global environment through
`print(ls())`.

### Package Management

---

Packages are useful in many cases. You can simply install them from the R
Console

```r
install.packages("package-name")
```

For this course, we will not use many packages, but will focus on the native R
tools. But you should have these installed: `dplyr`, `UsingR`, `knitr`

Apart from that, I recommend having a look at the `ggplot2` package, which
offers more powerful visualisation tools.

### Data Types

---

There are basic, and more abstract data types in R - most of which should be
very familiar to you from Python or other programming languages. However, R
provides out-of-the box data types for matrix operations (for which Python needs
the `numpy` package)

- **Logical**: `TRUE`/ `FALSE` (capitalisation matters)

- **Numeric**: `1`, `1.5`, `99.999` (integers and floats together)

- **Character**: `"a"`, `"good"`, `"23.4"` (strings)

- **Vectors**: Collection type, which automatically type converts (type
  coercion), st. all elements are of the same datatype. Printing the type of the
  vector therefore prints out the type of the elements stored inside)

- **List**: Store collection of items of different types

- **Matrix** A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. It can be
  created using a vector input to the matrix function.

- **Data Frame**: R comes bundled with a data frame class similar to pythons
  `pandas.DataFrame`. It allows to store header, multi-type frames and has
  specific operations, such as `names` (get column names), `head` (show first 5
  rows of data frame) and more.

See the below R script to see examples of how to intialise each of the types.

```r
L <- TRUE # FALSE (or T/F)
N <- 1
C <- 'test'
V <- c(1,2,'test')
L <- list(1, 2, 'test')
M <- matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
DF <- data.frame(
 gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"),
 height = c(152, 171.5, 165),
 weight = c(81,93, 78),
 Age    = c(42,38,26)
)
```

We can check the data type of an object, through the `class` function.

```r
print(class(3))
# "numeric"
```

## Statistics in R

---

Statistical analysis in R is performed by using many in-built functions. Most of
these functions are part of the R base package. These functions take R vector as
an input along with the arguments and give the result.

### Mean

---

Returns the arithemtic mean $\frac{\sum_i^n x_i}{n}$ for some vector $x$

```r
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```

_Allows to `trim` some percentage from both ends (to reduce risk of outliers
skewing the mean value and ignore `NA` values_

### Median

---

Returns the median for some vector $x$

```r
median(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```

### Distributions

---

```r
dnorm(x, mean, sd)
pnorm(x, mean, sd)
qnorm(p, mean, sd)
rnorm(n, mean, sd)
```

## Differences to Python

---

1. Usually executed in a line-by-line fashion within a global environment

2. Allowed to have `.` in variable naming

3. Use of `<-` as assignment operator

4. Can use `^` to raise a numeric (or collection of numerics) to some power

5. Natively supports data types and functions for statistical analysis and
   visualisation

6. Logical Operators are `&` / `|` and `!`, instead of english-like `and`, `or`
   and `not` in Python.
