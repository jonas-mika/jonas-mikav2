This week we are going to continue our study of matrices by looking at the **determinant**. The determinant is a real number $det(A)\in \R$ associated
with some square $n\times n$ matrix $A$.

_Note, that non-square matrices (per theorem) have an undefined determinant._

## Inductively Computing the Determinant

---

The determinant is defined by induction on the size of the matrix. This means that I will define it for $1\times 1$ matrices (such a thing is just a
number $[x]$, and the determinant is just $x$) and then give a way of computing the determinant of an $(n + 1) × (n + 1)$ matrix using only
determinants of $n × n$ matrices. In other words, the determinant of $4 × 4$ matrices is defined in terms of the determinant of $3 × 3$ matrices,
which is defined in terms of the determinant of $2 × 2$ matrices etc. The determinant of a $1\times 1$ matrix is the scalar itself. Mathematically, we
denote

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
det(A)=|A|=a_{11}
$$

For matrices of higher order, we use the notion of **minors** and **cofactors**.

For some square matrix $A$…

- … the **minor $M_{ij}$** **of the entry $a_{ij}$ **is the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of _A,
  and_
- … the **cofactor $C_{ij}$** of the entry $a_{ij}$ \*\*is $C_{ij}=(-1)^{i+j}M_{ij}$

_Note, that the cofactor of some entry is just the minor or the inverse of the minor. It is the inverse iff. the sum of the row and column index is
odd. This creates a checkerboard pattern on the $n\times n$ matrix._

Given this definition of minor and cofactors, we can define the determinant of any $n\times n$ matrix $A$ by expand either the $i$-th row or $j$-th
columns:

$$
\text{i-th row expansion: }det(A)=|A|=\sum_{j=1}^na_{ij}C_{ij}
$$

$$
\text{j-th column expansion: }det(A)=|A|=\sum_{i=1}^na_{ij}C_{ij}
$$

_Note: If the matrix has no zero entries, then we typically expand the first row. If there are zero entries, then it makes sense to expand the row/
column with the most zeros, as it requires the least computation._

## Closed Formulas for Determinants

---

There exist some closed formulas for determinants of matrices.

### 2x2 Matrices

---

The determinant of a $2\times 2$ matrix is the difference between the product of the elements on the main diagonal ($a_{11}a_{22}$) and the product of
the elements on the antidiagonal ($a_{21}a_{12}$). Mathematically, we denote for some $2\times 2$ matrix

$$
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
det(A)=|A|=a_{11}a_{22}-a_{21}a_{12}
$$

### 3x3 Matrices

---

A similar definition exists for $3\times 3$ matrices.

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
det(A)=|A|=a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}+a_{12}a_{23}a_{31}+a_{13}+a_{22}+a_{32}-a_{31}a_{22}a_{13}-a_{32}a_{23}a_{11}-a_{33}a_{21}a_{12}
$$

This formula can be remembered, by mentally concatenating the first two columns at the end of matrix $A$ (making it a $3\times 5$ matrix) and then
first add the products of the main diagonals and then subtract the products of the anti diagonals.

### **Triangular/ Diagonal Matrices**

---

Remember from last week, that a triangular matrix is defined as an upper triangular matrix if all entries below the main diagonal are zero, and a
lower triangular matrix if all entries above the main diagonal are zero. Applying the general formula for finding determinants leads to observing,
that the determinant for any triangular (and therefore also diagonal matrix) is just the product of the entries on the main diagonal. For any
triangular square $n\times n$ matrix $A$, the determinant.

$$
det(A)=|A|=a_{11}\cdot a_{22}\cdot ...\cdot a_{nn}
$$

_To verify this, imagine expanding the first column in an upper triangular matrix. Only the first entry is non-entry, so the determinant is
$a_{11}M*{11}$. The minor $M*{11}$ is a $n-1\times n-1$ upper triangular matrix. The same principle applies, so the determinant $a_{11}a_{22}M_{22}$.
Recursively following this logic leads to the above formula.\_

Note also that the observation, that the computation of determinants for reduced matrices is greatly simplified, allows for another approach for
computing the determinant of a matrix. Instead of using the inductive formula, we can simply reduce the matrix using elementary row operations (which
by definition produce equivalent systems) and then compute the determinant as the product of the elements on the main diagonal. However, we have to be
aware that although we produce equivalent systems, the determinant changes for certain EROs. Namely,

Let $A$ \**and $*B$\* be square matrices.

1. When $*B$* is obtained from $*A$* by interchanging two rows of $A$, $det(B) = −det(A).$
2. When $*B$* is obtained from *A* by adding a multiple of a row of *A* to another row of $*A\*$, $det(B) = det(A)$.
3. When $*B$* is obtained from $*A$* by multiplying a row of $*A$* by a nonzero constant $*c\*$,
$det(B) = c det(A)$

## Zero Determinant

---

Generally, determinants of square matrices can be negative, positive or zero. We observe, that if the determinant of some square matrix $A$,
$det(A)=0$, then the matrix is singular (non-invertible), i.e. there does not exist an inverse. If the matrix represents the coefficients of an SLE,
then that means the system has no solution. Generally, the following conditions lead to zero determinants:

1. An entire row (or entire column) consists of zeros
2. Two rows (or columns) are equal (_which leads to (1) through ERO_)
3. One row (or column) is a multiple of another row (or columns) (_which leads to (1) through ERO_)

## Computing Matrix Inverses from Determinant

---

We can compute the inverse of a matrix $A^{-1}$ if $|A|\ne 0$. Besides Gauss-Jordan, we can use the adjoint matrix $adj(A)$ to find the inverse. For
an invertible $n\times n$ matrix $A$,

$$
A^{-1}=\frac{1}{|A|}adj(A)
$$

Here, $adj(A)$ is the adjoint matrix, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.

## Properties of Determinants

---

Let’s look at some properties of matrices:

1. **Determinant of matrix product:** $|A|\cdot|B|=|AB|$
2. **Determinant of scaled matrix:** $|cA|=c^n|A|$
3. **Determinant of inverse:** $|A^{-1}|=1/|A|$
4. **Determinant of a transpose: $|A^T|=|A|$**
