This week we are going to study **vector functions**, which - speaking in the lingo introduced last week - are function $f:\R\rightarrow\R^n$, so
mappings from a single scalar (the domain) to multidimensional vectors. We call such functions vector functions, as they produce vectors as output.
Some of the most interesting applications of such functions arise in the context of physics when we model motion in two- or three-dimensional space
through vector functions from $\R$ to $\R^2$ or $\R^3$. For this reason, each section in this document is going to be two-split: first introducing the
purely mathematical base and then relating it to common applications in physics.

## Vector Functions

---

Vector functions are the first natural extension to univariate functions ($f:\R\rightarrow \R$) that we are going to study and we can view them as an
generalisation in the sense that we increase the dimensionality of the range $R_f\in\R^n$. What this means, is that we are no longer constraining
ourselves to functions with a single output value, but are studying functions whose outputs are _multidimensional vectors_ Mathematically, we describe
a _vector function_ $f:\R\rightarrow\R^n$ through a vector of components functions $f_1,...,f_n$, where the $i$-th component function produces the
$i$-th value of the output vector. We denote:

$$
f(x)=<f_1(x),f_2(x),...,f_n(x)>=\begin{bmatrix}f_1(x)\\f_2(x)\\\vdots \\ f_n(x)\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Application in Physics: Curves in Space

---

Now, you might ask why we would need such functions. One of the most common applications is the study of motion in two- and three-dimensional space of
particles in physics. In these examples, we model the $(x,y)$ or $(x,y,z)$ position of some element at some point in time $t$ through the vector
function $r:\R\rightarrow \R^2$ through real-valued, continuous component functions $f,g:\R\rightarrow\R$.

Or similarly, in three-dimensional space through three component functions, s.t $r:\R\rightarrow\R^3$, which is composed of three real-valued,
continuous component functions $f,g,h:\R\rightarrow\R$

$$
r(t)=<f(t), g(t), h(t)>=\begin{bmatrix}f(t)\\g(t)\\h(t)\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note, that we can visualise vector functions through their graph, which allows us to visually inspect the position of some particle at any defined
point in time $t$. As we need two dimensions to show graphs for functions $f:\R\rightarrow \R$, we can show vector functions of the functional form
$f:\R\rightarrow\R^2$ in three-dimensional space, and we cannot plot any higher dimension (as we are not able to visually in higher than three
dimensions).

## Derivatives of Vector Functions

---

Last week, we have developed the notion of derivatives to talk about _instantaneous rate-of-change_ of functions, which has interesting applications
in optimisation problems.

Luckily, most of the notions and rules we developed last week, carry over to derivatives of vector functions. A vector function’s derivative is simply
the vector of derivatives of all its component functions. If we assume a function $r:\R\rightarrow\R^n$, and name its $n$ component function
$f_1,...f_n$, then we write the derivative as

$$
r'(t)=<f_1'(t), f_2'(t), ..., f_n'(t)>=\begin{bmatrix}f_1'(t)\\f_2'(t)\\\vdots \\f_n'(t)\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Application in Physics: Velocity/ Acceleration Function

---

If we assume that two- and three-dimensional vector functions $r(t):\R\rightarrow \R^{2/3}$ are modelling the motion of a particle through space and
time (specifically, what is the position of some object in two- or three dimensional space after $t$ time), then…

1. …the first derivative $r'(t)$ models the **velocity of the particle** (at any point in time $t$)
2. …the second derivative $r''(t)$ models the **acceleration of the particle** (at any point in time $t$)

**Speed of a Curve**

Note that the velocity of a particle is a $n$-dimensional vector and - though related - not the speed of the particle. Once we computed the velocity
function (as the first derivative of the motion curve), we can compute the velocity vector of the particle at any point $t$. Now, if we are interested
in the speed of the particle at some point $t$, then we need to compute the length of the velocity vector, which is defined to be the speed. Thus, we
can write that the speed of a curve described through $r(t)$ can be written as

$$
||r'(t)||=\sqrt{r_1'(t)^2+...+r_n'(t)^2}
$$

$$
r(t)=<f(t), g(t)>=\begin{bmatrix}f(t)\\g(t)\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Arc Length**

Another natural question to ask about motion in space modelled through vector functions is the question about the _arc length_, so the total length
(distance) of the motion within some time interval. It turns out, that we can compute the arc length within some interval $[a,b]$ as the integral over
the speed function $||r'(t)||:\R\rightarrow\R$, so

$$
\int_a^b||r'(t)|| dt
$$
