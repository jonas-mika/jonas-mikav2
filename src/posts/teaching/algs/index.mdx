# Algorithms and Data Structures

---

Welcome to **Algorithms and Data Structures** Spring 2022. To be an effective
programmer, you must know not only how to make a computer compute things, but
how to efficiently compute things. This course provides the basic algorithmic
tools indispensable for every software developer. Topics covered are among
others complexity analysis, big-O, algorithmic problem solving techniques
including divide-and-conquer, concrete algorithms and data structures for search
trees, sorting, hashing, graphs, shortest paths.
