Whenever we observe some (single) random process in nature, we can define the
sample space holding all possible outcomes and assign probabilities to each
single (elementary) event. These two properties are provide a complete
probabilistic description of that specific experiment.

However, most often we are only interested in certain (numeric) features of the
random process. Such numeric features can be modelled through **random
variables**.

### Definition

---

In probability and statistics, a random variable, usually denoted through
capital letters such as $X$, is described informally as a variable whose values
depend on outcomes of a random phenomenon. Mathematically, a random variable is
a function defined on a probability space (sample space) that maps from the
sample space (domain) to the real numbers (range).

$$
X : \Omega \rightarrow R
$$

### Domain and Range

---

The domain of some random variable $X$ is inherently defined through the random
experiment the random variable is associated with, since the domain of the
random variable is just the entire sample space $\Omega/S$. If we i.e. consider
two consecutive rolls of a dice, then the domain of some $X$ that is associated
with this random experiment is

$$
D_X=\Omega/S=\{(x_1,x_2)|\ x_1,x_2\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\}
$$

The _range_ (sometimes _image_) of a random variable $X$, shown by $Range(X)$ or
$R_X$, is the set of all possible values $X$ can contain. We differentiate
between _discrete_ and _continuous_ random variables, depending on whether the
set of all numbers the random variable can obtain is finite or infinite.

### Probability Distributions

---

Just as we needed a probability function that associated probabilities to each
event defined in the event space, we need a probabilistic measure for describing
the behaviour of our random variable. For the different types of random
variables, we will encounter different probabilistic functions, namely:

- Probability Mass Function (PMF) in the discrete case

- Probability Density Function (PDF) in the continuous case

- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) in both the discrete and continuous
  case

### Discrete Random Variables

---

Formally, a discrete random variable is a function $X: \Omega \to E$ that is
defined on the domain of the sample space of the observed experiment and
computes a finite number of values $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ or an countably infinite
number of values $x_1, x_2, ...$ (where discrete means that there is no in
between those values) in a measurable space $E$. The discrete random variable
thereby is a specific feature we are interested in that is defined on a discrete
scale.

### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

---

Once a discrete random variable $X$ is introduced, the sample space $\Omega$ is
not of that much importance anymore. It suffices to list the possible values of
$X$ ($R_X$) and their corresponding probabilities. The information about the
probabilities of each value of $X$ is contained in the so-called **probability
mass function** (or short: **PMF**). The function describes how the probability
mass is distributed over all possible values of $X$ (hence the name). We denote
formally:

The **probability mass function** $f$ (sometimes also: $p$) of a discrete random
variable $X$ is a discontinuous function $f/p: \R \to [0,1]$, defined as:

$$
p_X(x)=f_X(x)=P(X=x)\ \forall\ -\infty \le x \le \infty
$$

_Note that the PMF is defined on the domain of the entire real-numbers. However,
we often only report for the values the random variable can obtain and disregard
all others by defining $f(x)=P(X=x)=0\ \forall\ x \notin \R_X$._

Since the PMF is a probability function, it has the following two properties:

1. Non-Negativity: $0 \ge p(x) \ge 1$ for all $x \in R$

2. Unity Sum: $\sum_{x \in R_X} p(x) = 1$

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

---

Another way to describe the probability distribution of a _discrete random
variable_ $X$ is through a so-called distribution function, also cumulative
distribution function (or short: **CDF**). Just like the PMF, it contains all
probabilistic information of $X$. Unlike the PMF however, the CDF can also be
computed for continuous random variables, and therefore allows us to treat them
in the same way. We denote formally:

The **distribution function** or **cumulative distribution** function $F$ of a
random variable $X$ is the function $F:\R \to [0,1]$, defined as:

$$
F_X(x)=P(X\le x) \text{ for} -\infty \le x \le \infty \text{ or } x \in R_X
$$

For _discrete random variables_, the two functions (PMF and CDF) are closely
linked to one another, ie. the distribution function $F$ can be expressed in
terms of the probability mass function $p$, and vice versa.

$$
F_X(x)=P(X\le x) = \sum_{x_i \le x} P(X=x_i)=\sum_{x_i \le x} f_X(x_i)
$$

**Properties**

1. For two values $a\le b$, it must follow that $F(a) \le F(b)$, since the event
   $\{X \le a\}$ is contained in $\{X \le b\}$ if $a \le b$

2. Since $F(a)$ is a probability function, its values are always on the range
   $[0,1]$

3. $F$ approaches 0 for $x$ approaching negative infinity and 1 for $x$
   approaching positive infinity, independent of the problem at hand. Formally,
   we denote: $\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x)  = 1$ and $\lim_{x \to -\infty}F(x)=0$

## Theoretical Distributions of Random Variables

---

Certain random variables occur very often in probability theory because they
well describe many natural or physical processes. Their distributions,
therefore, have gained special importance in probability theory. Some
fundamental discrete distributions are the discrete uniform, Bernoulli,
binomial, negative binomial, Poisson and geometric distributions. Important
continuous distributions include the continuous uniform, normal, exponential,
gamma and beta distributions.

### Discrete Uniform Distribution

---

The simplest discrete distribution is the so-called _discrete uniform
distribution_. Because it is so intuitive and often the first encountered
example in every introduction to probability theory, it is often not even named.

A discrete uniform distribution is a symmetric probability distribution wherein
a finite number of possible values are equally likely to be observed. This means
that for each elementary event $s_i$ for all $s_i \in \Omega$, we can assign
equal probabilities. From the fact that the probabilities for each event in a
sample space is the number of occurrences divided by the number of all possible
outcomes, we can define the probability for each elementary event for some
discrete uniform distributed process as $P(x_i)=\frac{1}{|\Omega |}$ .

We denote that some discrete random variable $X$ is distributed uniformly as
$X \sim U(a, b)$ for $a$, $b$ being integers, such as $a \le b$ and
$n=|\Omega|=b-a+1$. The distribution functions are then defined as:

$$
f_X(x)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{b-a+1}=\frac{1}{n} \text{ for }a \le x \le b \\ 0
\text{ else}\end{cases}
$$

$$
F_X(x)=\frac{\lfloor x \rfloor -a+1}{n}
$$

## Bernoulli Distribution

The Bernoulli distribution is used whenever we observe some experiment that
involves randomness that only has two possible outcomes, often referred to as
success and failure and typically integer-encoded as $1$ and $0$. We model this
through a Bernoulli distributed, discrete random variable $X$. In contrast to
the uniform discrete distribution, the two possible event within the sample
space, must not have equal probability. We denote the probability of success
($P(X=1)$) as $p$ and, as a consequence, the probability of failure as
$P(X=0)=1-p$.

Since the entire distribution is well-defined through the success probability
(by the additivity of probabilities, we can compute the counter-probability
through $1-p$), the Bernoulli distribution only has a single function parameter.

We say that $X$ is a Bernoulli experiment and denote $X \sim Ber(p)$ for some
$0 \le p \le 1$. Then, we can define the PMF and CDF as follows:

$$
p_X(x)=\begin{cases}p \text{ for x=1}\\ 1-p \text{ for x=0} \\ 0 \text{
else}\end{cases}
$$

$$
F(x)= \begin{cases} 0 \text{ if x < 0} \\ 1-p \text{ if 0 <= x < 1} \\ 1 \text{
if x>=1}\end{cases}
$$

### Binomial Distribution

---

The natural extension of a single _Bernoulli trial_, where we are given the
probability of success with some $p$, is to perform $n$ independent Bernoulli
trials - also called _Bernoulli sequence_ - and model our random variable $X$ as
the number of successes in the performed $n$ trials.

We denote this extension of the Bernoulli distribution as the _binomial
distribution_ (or the other way around: $Ber(p)= Bin(n=1,p)$). The binomial
distribution with parameters $n$, the number of independent Bernoulli trials and
$p$, the success probability on each trial, is the discrete probability
distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of $n$ independent
Bernoulli experiments, so experiment that ask yes-no question, and each with its
own boolean-valued outcome.

We say, that some discrete random variable $X$ is binomially distributed, st.
$X \sim Bin(n,p)$ with $n$ the number of trials $n \in \N=\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ and
$p \in [0,1]$. The range $R_X$ is the sequence of natural numbers from 0 to $n$,
since these are the minimal and maximum number of successes in $n$ Bernoulli
trials ($R_X=\{0, 1, 2, ...,n\}$). The PMF and CDF are defined as:

$$
p(X=k)= \begin{cases} {n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \text{ for } k\in R_X \\ 0
\text{ else} \end{cases}
$$

, where ${n \choose k}$ is the _binomial coefficient_. The binomial coefficient
, used in the context of combinatorics, computes the number of ways to choose
$k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. Mathematically, we can compute:

$$
{n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

We read the formula as follows: $k$ successes occur with probability $p^k$ and
$n-k$ failures occur with probability $(1-p)^{n-k}$. However, the $k$ successes
can occur anywhere among the $n$ trials, and there are $n \choose k$ different
ways of distributing $k$ successes in a sequence of $n$ trials.

$$
F*X(k)=\sum*{i=0}^k {n \choose i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i}
$$

We have easy access to the PMF, CDF, Inverse CDF and a way to sample randomly
from the distribution in base R:

```r
# pmf (probability of having k successes in n trials with success prob p)
dbinom(x, size, prob)

# cdf (probability of having at most k successes in n trials with success prob p)
pbinom(x, size, prob)

# inverse cdf (k successes such that the probability of being at most this k is given by p) for which prob x is guaranteed
qbinom(p, size, prob)

# n samples from Bin(n,p)
qbinom(n, size, prob)
```

### Geometric Distribution

---

The geometric distribution is another way of investigating $n$ independent
Bernoulli trials, each with a success probability of $p$. This time, however, we
are not interested in the number of successes $k$ within this Bernoulli
sequence, but are rather interested in the fact, at which trail we obtain our
first success. We can model such a discrete random variable through the
geometric distribution.

_Note, that there exist two different conventions when talking about geometric
distributions, depending on how we interpret the parameter $k$:_

1. $k = \text{First Success}$: The probability distribution of the number $X$ of
   Bernoulli experiments needed to get one success, defined on the set
   $\{n \in Z : n>0\} =\{1,2,3, ...\}$

2 .$k = \text{Failures before First Success}$: The probability distribution of
the number $Y=X-1$ of failures before the first success, defined on the set
$\{n \in
   Z : n \ge 0\} =\{0,1,2,3, ...\}$ → R uses this

_We see that the two ways of denoting the geometric distributions are only
shifted by 1. Which one of these is called "the" geometric distributions is a
matter of convention and convenience._

We denote a discrete random variable to follow a geometric distribution and
denote $X \sim Geo(p)$ for $p\in [0,1]$ giving the success probability.

$R_X(first\ success)=\{1,2, 3, ...\}$ and
$R_X(failures\ before\ success=\{0, 1, 2, ...\}$

_Note, that the geometric distribution is defined on a countably infinite sample
space. This means that there are (potentially) infinitely large values for $k$,
modelling that the success never occurs._

A discrete random variable $X$ has a geometric distribution with parameter $p$,
where $0 \le p \le 1$ and $p$ is the probability of success in each Bernoulli
experiment. We can denote the distributions as follows

$$
p_X(k)= \begin{cases} (1-p)^{k-1}p \text{ for } k\in R_X \\ 0 \text { else}
\end{cases}
$$

_(for $k = \text{First Success}$)_

$$
p_X(k)= \begin{cases} (1-p)^{k}p \text{ for } k\in R_X \\ 0 \text{ else}
\end{cases}
$$

_($k = \text{Failures before First Success}$)_

_Note, that R uses the convention of $k$ failures before the first success, and
thus dgeom(0, prob) is well-defined._

```r
# pmf (probability of having x failures before first success (x+1 trials for first success))
dgeom(x, prob)

# cdf (probability of having at most x failures before first success)
pgeom(x, prob)

# inverse cdf (outputs the value of X for which the probability is at most p)
qgeom(p, prob)

# n samples from Geo(p)
rgeom(n, prob)
```
