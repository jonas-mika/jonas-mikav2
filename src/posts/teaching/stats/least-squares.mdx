A widely spread method to compute this best-fitting line is called the method of
least squares. As the name suggests: We are trying to find the line that
minimises the sum of squared deviation between every data point and the
regression line. Formally, we define:

$$
S(a,b)=\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-a-bx_i)^2
$$

Note, that the $i$th term in the sum is the squared distance in the vertical
direction from $(x_i,y_i)$ to the regression line - as we defined it. To find
the regression parameters $a$ ("y-intercept") and $b$ ("slope of the line") we
need to minimise $S$. We do this by finding the two partial derivatives of
$\frac{\delta S}{\delta a}$ and $\frac{\delta S}{\delta b}$ and set them to
zero.

$$
\frac{\delta}{\delta a}S(a,b)=0\leftrightarrow\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-a-bx_i)=0 \\
\frac{\delta}{\delta b}S(a,b)=0\leftrightarrow\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-a-bx_i)x_i =0
$$

After some transformations, we arrive at the two terms.

$$
na+b\sum_{i=1}^nx_i=\sum_{i=1}^ny_i \\
a\sum_{i=1}^nx_i+b\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2=\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i
$$

We have two equations in two unknown parameters $a$ and $b$, that we need to
solve. After solving we find that

$$
\hat{b}=\frac{n\sum x_iy_i-(\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{n\sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2}
$$

$$
\hat{a}=\hat{y}_n-\hat{b}\hat{x}_n
$$

We can use these formulas to deterministically find the regression parameters
between the samples of two random variables $X$ and $Y$.

## Linear Regression in Code

---

We can easily compute the least square fit between the realisation of two random
variables in base R.

```r
# linear regression in base r
plot(reponse ~ predictor, main='Correlation between X and Y', xlab='X',
ylab='Y')
# linear model
model <- lm(response ~ predictor) abline(model, col='red')
```

Similarly, we can use the `ggplot` package, to

```r
ggplot(
   data = Cars93,
   aes(x = Horsepower, y = MPG.highway))
   + geom_point()
   + geom_smooth(formula=y~x, method = "lm", se = FALSE)
   + labs(
      title='Scatter of Horspower to Fuel Consumption',
      subtitle='Linear Regression through Least Squares',
      x='Horsepower',
      y='Fuel Consumption (Miles per Gallon)'
   )
```
