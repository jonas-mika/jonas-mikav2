Probability and statistics are dealing with and trying to make sense of
randomness. All day we encounter phenomena that appear random to us.

Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that tries to fit together the
deterministic world of mathematics with the uncertainity confronting us in the
physical world. It promises to sensibly model this uncertainity quantitively.

> Probability theory is a mathematical framework for dealing with random events.
> It is the foundation for statistics and machine learning.

Throughout this course, we will learn about basic concepts of probability
theory. Today we start by agreeing on some basic terminology and notation, when
modelling random phenomena. We introduce the notion of a **sample space** as the
set of all possible outcomes of a **random experiment**, define **events** and
**probabilities** to them.

Later in the course, we go on to define random variables and mathematical tools
to deal with them, as well as characterise commonly observed randomness in
nature through well-known probability distributions.

All this knowledge will serve us as a basis to make sense of observed samples of
random processes (datasets) to describe and infer knowledge in a statistically
sound way. Defeatedly, we will admit that we can never be 100% certain about our
statement, but we will develop tools to at least _quantify_ our uncertainity.

## Random Experiments

---

All processes of interest in probability theory involve some kind of randomness.
In probability theory a random process is often called a **random experiment**
and is characterised as follows:

> An experiment is called random, if the outcome of the experiment is uncertain.

To make sense of the behaviour of a random process, one needs to follow three
steps:

1. **Define Outcomes**: What can we possibly observe in the random experiment?

2. **Define Events**: What combination of outcomes can we possibly observe?

3. **Assign Probabilities**: How likely is each event to occur?

In probability theory, this triple is called the **probability space** or
**probability triple**, which is denoted as $(\Omega, F, P)$. It is a
mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random experiment at
hand. In the following sections, we will discover each element in detail.

## Sample Space

---

Any random process produces some known range of _possible outcomes_ (= a result
of a random experiment). The set of all possible outcomes is denoted as the
**sample space** (sometimes also _sample description space_ or _possibility
space_) $\Omega / S$.

> The sample space $\Omega / S$ is a set, whose elements describe all possible
> outcomes of a random experiment.

### Conditions of Sample Spaces

---

A set $\Omega/S$ with outcomes $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$, such that
$\Omega = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$ must meet some conditions in order to be a
sample space:

1. The outcomes must be **mutually exclusive**, i.e. if some elementary event
   $A$ takes place, then no other event in the sample space can take place.

2. the outcomes must be **mutually exhaustive**, i.e. every realisation of the
   experiment will yield an outcome from the sample space (there is no other
   outcome than the one's defined in the sample space)

The sample space must have the *right granularity* depending on what we are
interested in. We must remove irrelevant information from the sample space. In
other words, we must choose the right level of abstraction.

_Note, that the sample space $\Omega/S$ is the universal set. So for some random
experiment, the sample space defines the entire world in observance. In Venn
Diagram's the sample space would be the rectangle, that contains several
subsets._

### Mathematical Background

---

Since, after all, the sample space is nothing more than a mathematical set - so
a collection of items, which in this case have some specified meaning, all rules
and characteristics we have discovered apply.

We can differentiate between different types of random experiments that produce
different sets of possible outcomes. The set of outcomes of some random process,
inherently determines the way we deal with quantifying it, so it is important to
differentiate between the different types of sample spaces:

- **Finite Sets**: Flipping a Fair Coin

- **Countably Infinite**: First Heads when flipping a Fair Coin

- **Infinite Sets**: Measuring Human Heights

_For finite sets, we can furthermore determine the cardinality of the sample
space, that is defined as the number of elements in the set._

### Compound Random Processes

---

Basic to statistics is that one usually does not consider one experiment, but
that the same experiment is performed several times. For example, suppose we
throw a coin two, ten or a million times. When we deal with a compound random
process, we are firstly interested in the new sample space, so the new set of
all possible outcomes. This is easy enough to define:

For $n$ repeated similar experiments with sample spaces
$\Omega_1, \Omega_2, ..., \Omega_n$, the combined experiment has the cartesian
product as its sample space, such that our new $\Omega$:

$$
\Omega = \Omega_1 \times \Omega_2 \times ... \times \Omega_n= \{(w_1,w_2, ...., w_n) | w_1 \in \Omega_1, w_2 \in \Omega_2, ..., w_n \in \Omega_n\}
$$

Note that for $\Omega_1$ having $r$ elements and $\Omega_2$ having $s$ elements,
the product of the two sample spaces $\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2$ has $r \cdot s$
elements. We can denote

$$
|\Omega| = |\Omega_1|\cdot |\Omega_2|
$$

## Events

---

The sample space answer "_Which outcomes can possibly occur?_". Often, we are
interested in particular events from this set. Events therefore answer the
question "_How likely is this event to occur?_".

Mathematically, **events** are defined as subset of the sample space. Is that
can be defined on the sample space and try to assign probabilities to the
different outcomes that might occur. Mathematically speaking, **events** are
defined as subset of the sample space (universal set)

> In probability theory, an event is a subset of the sample space. We say that
> an event $A$ occurs if the outcome of a single experiment is an element of the
> set $A$.

$$
A \subset \Omega \text{ (Event A in Sample Space)}
$$

### Event Space

---

It is important to observe, that the bigger our sample space gets, the more
distinct combinations are there that form a subset of the sample space. However,
the event space - in set theory referred to as the _power set of $\Omega$ -_ is
the set of all subsets of $\Omega$, including $\Omega$ itself and the empty set
$\empty.$

_Note, that there are some special types of events within the power set that
have special names. Namely, we speak of the empty set $\empty$ for the set
containing nothing and deterministically define its probability to be zero and
elementary events (also: atomic event or singleton) for events which only
contain a single outcome in the sample space._

### Multiple Events

---

Since events are subsets of a bigger set, we can combine more events and denote
the sets using the notation of mathematical set theory. Let's revisit the common
set operations for two events $A$ and $B$ within the sample sapce $\Omega$:

- **Union of Events**: $A \cup B\  (A \text{ or } B)$, meaning $A\cup B$ occurs
  if $A$ or $B$ occurs.

- **Intersection**: $A \cap B\ (A \text{ and } B)$, meaning that $A\cap B$
  occurs if $A$ and $B$ occur.

- **Complement**: $A^c = \{w\in\Omega | w \notin A\}$, meaning that $A^C$ occurs
  if $A$ does not occur.

- **Disjoint/ Mutually Exclusive**: $A\cap B=\empty$, meaning that $A$ and $B$
  can never occur together. $A$ happening implies $~B$, and vice versa.

- **Implication**: $A \in B$, meaning that an event $A$ implies event $B$ if the
  outcomes of $A$ also lie in $B$. Implication is the opposite of disjointness.

**Venn diagrams** are very useful in visualising relation between sets. In a
Venn diagram any set is depicted by a closed region. We can use it to depict
events and their unions/ intersections and differences in the cosmos of
probability theory.

## Probabilities

---

Each event can be assigned a **probability**, which quantifies how likely it is
that the event occurs.

Mathematically, we say that for some event $A$, we are seeking for a number
$P(A)$ quantifying the likeliness of the event. As this number is a probability
measures, it has to fulfill certain criteria. These criteria are called the
**axioms of probabilities**.

### Axioms of Probabilities

---

We assign a probability to some event $A$ through a probability function, such
that $P(A)$ is a value between $0$ and $1$ that shows how likely it is that the
event occurs.

1. **Non-Negativity**: For any event $A$, $0 \le P(A) \le 1$

2. **Mutually Exhaustive**: No other event than defined in the sample space can
   occur. Therefore, the probability of the sample space is $P(\Omega)=1$

3. **Additivity of Disjoint Events**: If $A_1, A_2, ..., A_N$ are disjoint
   events, then  
   $P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+...+P(A_N)$

4. **Probability of the complement**: For some event $A$ occurring with
   probability $P(A)$, the probability of the event not happening is
   $P(A^C)=1-P(A)$.

   $$
   \begin{align*}
   P(A^C \cup A) &= 1 \\
   P(A^C) + P(A) &= 1 \\
   P(A^C) &= 1 - P(A) \\
   \end{align*}
   $$

### Probability of Empty Set

---

Since $P(\empty)=1-P(s)=0$, also by definition occurs if the outcome of the
experiment is an element of the subset defined by the event, since $\empty$ does
not contain an element, this is impossible and thus $P(\empty)=0$

### Probability of General Union

---

We have seen that the union of two disjoint events (either event $A$ or event
$B$ happens) occurs with the probability of the sum of the two individual
events. However, if we cannot assume the disjointness of the events, we have to
take into consideration their intersection elementary events. The probability of
the union of two general events is therefore:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A \cup B)  &= P(A \cup (B-A))\\
             &=P(A)+P(B-A)\\
             &=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)
\end{align*}
$$

_Note, that we can also verify our third axiom of probabilities: The additive
property of disjoint events, as $P(A \cap B)=0$ for $A$ and $B$ being disjoint_
