This project was a group exam project in the course network analysis. The goal of the project was to build a recommendation system for GitHub
repositories, based on the 2009 GitHub bipartite network, representing users watching repositories (unweighted graph). A similar pipeline as used
within this project can be applied generically to any bipartite graph, to build a recommendation for either of the two classes.

While the focus of this project was on understanding, applying and arguing in favor or against theoretical concepts of network analysis using
real-life data, the final product - a recommendation graph - was translated into a simple web-app.
