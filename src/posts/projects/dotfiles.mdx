As a data scientist and developer I spend a lot of time in my terminal. Over the past years, I have customised my terminal to perfectly suit my
workflow and maximise my productivity. My current development environment consists of:

- [alacritty](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/alacritty) as my primary **terminal**
- [fish](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/fish) as my primary **shell**
- [nvim](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim) as my primary **text editor**
- [vsc](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/) as my secondary text editor (for java and webdev projects)
- [vim](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.vim) for a minimal vim setup (used for Vim emulations and on VMs)
- [tmux](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/tmux) for managing terminal sessions
- [brew](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/brew) for macOS package management
- [hammerspoon](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/hammerspoon) for macOS customisation
- [karabiner](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/karabiner) for custom key-bindings
- [commitizen](https://github.com/mikasenghaas/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/commitizen) for standardised git commit messages
