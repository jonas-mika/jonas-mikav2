**ITU Coffee Talks** brings ITU staff and students together for engaging, research-focused discussions within the realm of computer science. Designed to foster a closer connection between faculty and students, the talks offer a unique opportunity for students to delve into academic topics with their professor in an informal environment beyond the regular classroom setting.

I started co-organising the event 2023. In this role I created the organisation's [website](https://coffee-talks.vercel.app), which is a simple Astro static-site displaying past and upcoming events with a search functionality. The style of the website matches the relaxed, laid-back philosophy of the organisation.
