AITU is a student organisation at ITU that connects the brightest minds in the field of ML to engage in reading groups, lab projects and externals talks within the field of artificial intelligence research.
As a co-founder, I am proud to be part of a community of like-minded students and am excited about the future of the organisation.

On the [AITU Website](https://www.aitu.group) (which I developed) you can find more details about the organisation, including blog posts about recent activities and events within the organisation. Here you can also apply to be part of the group. Find us on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/aitu-dk) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aitu-dk).
